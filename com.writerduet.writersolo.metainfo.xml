	<p>NOTICE: THIS WRAPPER IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH UPSTREAM! </p>
	<p> If you have issues with the flatpak environment, post an issue on the github repo. Otherwise, please redirect all questions and comments to writerduet themselves<br>
	WriterSolo is a free version of WriterDuet that is not synced to any servers. <br>
	You get all the same features of WriterDuet, just without collaboration or any connection to an external server <br>
	You can seamlessly convert from fdx, to fountain, or even PDF.</p>
	<p>For now, will only work with XWayland because it doesn't play nice with native wayland.</p>
