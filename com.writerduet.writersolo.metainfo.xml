	<p>NOTICE: THIS WRAPPER IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH UPSTREAM! </p>
	<p>This is the free version of WriterDuet without any collaboration features to it. Excellent for working with fdx (final draft), 
	fountain, and even will give you verbose feedback and can export to PDF or any other format you need. Take any problems with the app to writerduet who develop it and issues with the flatpak to the github repo.</p>
