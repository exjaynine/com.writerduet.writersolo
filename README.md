# WriterSolo
WriterSolo is a free offline application entirely dedicated to screenwriting. It is the free version of writerduet and can easily convert between fdx (final draft), PDF, and even fountain files to make it incredibly easy to write a screenplay regardless of which program you wrote the script in at first. Nothing is synced to external servers.

I'm going to ask you to please only post issues or requests if it has to do with the flatpak environment itself. I have zero control over the app itself and my only association with the app is maintaining the flatpak app for flathub, not associated with writerduet at all. If you have comments or questions about writersolo itself, you can visit https://writersolo.com for more information or email them directly at `
help@writerduet.com
`

Issues or Pull Requests to improve this flatpak installation is always welcome. I encourage it.
