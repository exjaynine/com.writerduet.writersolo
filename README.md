# WriterSolo
I'm going to ask you to please only post issues or requests if it has to do with the flatpak environment itself. I have zero control over the app itself and my only association with the app is maintaining the flatpak app for flathub, not associated with writerduet at all. If you have comments or questions about writersolo itself, you can visit https://writersolo.com for more information or email them directly at `
help@writerduet.com
`

Issues or Pull Requests to improve this flatpak installation is always welcome. I encourage it.
